# Lumeo - A Personal Media Gallery

Lumeo is a Next.js application that acts as a personal media gallery, using Telegram for file storage and Supabase for metadata management. It allows you to upload, view, and manage your photos, videos, and documents in a clean, web-based interface.

## Features

-   **Album Organization:** Group your files into albums for easy categorization.
-   **Multi-file Type Support:** Upload and manage images, videos, and other documents.
-   **Telegram-based Storage:** Leverages Telegram's robust and generous file storage capabilities.
-   **Supabase Backend:** Uses Supabase for fast and reliable metadata storage and querying.
-   **Responsive Gallery:** A masonry-style gallery for viewing your media.
-   **File Management:** Edit captions and manage your files.
-   **Trash Bin:** Soft-delete files and restore them later, or delete them permanently.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### 1. Environment Setup

First, create a new file named `.env.local` in the root of your project. Copy the contents of the example below into this new file. You will fill in the values in the next steps.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=
```

### 2. Supabase Setup

Supabase will be used to store the metadata for your files, such as captions, file IDs, and timestamps.

**A. Create a Supabase Project:**

1.  Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and sign in or create a new account.
2.  Click on "**New project**" and give it a name and a secure database password.
3.  Wait for your project to be provisioned.

**B. Get API Keys:**

1.  Once your project is ready, navigate to the **Project Settings** (the gear icon in the left sidebar).
2.  Click on the **API** tab.
3.  Under **Project API keys**, you will find the **Project URL** and the `anon` `public` key.
4.  Copy the **URL** and paste it as the value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` in your `.env.local` file.
5.  Copy the **anon key** and paste it as the value for `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in your `.env.local` file.

**C. Create Tables and Policies:**

1.  Go to the **SQL Editor** (the database icon in the left sidebar).
2.  Click "**New query**".
3.  Copy the entire SQL script below and paste it into the editor.
4.  Click the "**Run**" button. This will create the `files` and `albums` tables and enable the necessary access policies.

```sql
-- Create the albums table
CREATE TABLE public.albums (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT
);

-- Create the files table
CREATE TABLE public.files (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  file_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  caption TEXT,
  type TEXT NOT NULL,
  tg_message_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  thumbnail_file_id TEXT,
  deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ WITH TIME ZONE,
  album_id BIGINT REFERENCES public.albums(id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

-- Enable Row Level Security for albums
ALTER TABLE public.albums ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies for public access on albums
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access for albums"
ON public.albums FOR SELECT
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow public insert access for albums"
ON public.albums FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow public update access for albums"
ON public.albums FOR UPDATE
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow public delete access for albums"
ON public.albums FOR DELETE
USING (true);

-- Enable Row Level Security for files
ALTER TABLE public.files ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies for public access on files
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access for files"
ON public.files FOR SELECT
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow public insert access for files"
ON public.files FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow public update access for files"
ON public.files FOR UPDATE
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow public delete access for files"
ON public.files FOR DELETE
USING (true);

```

### 3. Telegram Setup

Telegram will be used as the actual file storage backend.

**A. Create a Telegram Bot:**

1.  Open Telegram and search for the **BotFather** (the official bot for managing other bots).
2.  Start a chat and send the `/newbot` command.
3.  Follow the instructions to choose a name and a username for your bot. The username must end in "bot" (e.g., `LumeoGalleryBot`).
4.  BotFather will provide you with a **bot token**. Copy this token and paste it as the value for `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` in your `.env.local` file.

**B. Create a Public Channel:**

1.  In Telegram, create a new **public channel** (not a private one). The channel's public link will be used to find its ID.
2.  Add your newly created bot to this channel as an **Administrator**. This is crucial, as the bot needs permissions to post and delete messages.

**C. Get the Channel ID:**

1.  The channel ID is its username, prefixed with `@`. For example, if your public channel's link is `t.me/my_lumeo_gallery`, your channel ID is `@my_lumeo_gallery`.
2.  Paste this ID as the value for `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID` in your `.env.local` file.

### 4. Running the Application

Now that your environment is configured, you can run the app.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result. You can start by uploading files via the "Upload" link in the sidebar.
